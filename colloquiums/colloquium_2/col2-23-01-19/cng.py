# This is a file containing all necessary numbers for the game.
# The reason for this is to have a quick overview of all the initial
# values that can bee changed. These numbers (so-called "magic numbers")
# should under no circumstances be placed directly in the code. Imagine
# having to search through 1000 lines of code (or even more!) just to change
# that one value. Note that all variables declared in this file are all upper-case.
