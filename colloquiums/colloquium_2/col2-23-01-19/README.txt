The goal of the source code is to give a basic demonstration
of how Pygame works with the use of object-oriented principles. 

The code shows how one could create classes for objects to be
drawn on the screen. In this case the object is a "ball" or "circle".
A method is also implemented in the ball-class which makes it possible 
to move along a linear axis.

To run the code, locate to the directory where the code is located
and run the following command:
    $ python main.py 

If you get an error because of this, you may want to run:
    $ python3 main.py

The code is definetly not perfect or optimal in any way, as it
was coded on-the-go during a T.A lecture.

The code has also been thouroghly commented to help you understand what is done.

(In general there should always be a readme-file submitted along with
the project. This file should contain information about the program (like 
what it does, or how to control it), and how to run it).
